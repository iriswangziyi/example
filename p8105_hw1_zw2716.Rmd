```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

##Problem 1
Create a data frame comprised of:
- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
prob1_df =
    tibble(
        samp = rnorm(10),
        samp_grt_0 = samp > 0,
        char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
        factor_vec = c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod","mod", "high", "high", "high")
    )
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```
